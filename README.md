# Train-Crash-Survival-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Project Description:
This project involves developing an object-oriented solution to predict train crash survival outcomes based on passenger data. The dataset contains information about passengers, including whether they survived (1) or died (0) in the crash. The goal is to clean, explore, and model the data to determine factors influencing survival.

The solution follows these steps:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing data, remove unwanted records, and clean the dataset for further analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct basic data exploration, identify variables that should not be selected for modeling, and perform outlier detection and treatment.
Feature Selection and Preparation: Partition the dataset into training and testing sets using a random state of 12345.
Modeling: Build and evaluate the following models:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Find the optimal value of K and evaluate its accuracy.
Logistic Regression: Build the model and evaluate its accuracy.
Decision Tree: Build and evaluate the decision tree, tuning the tree depth for optimal performance.
Model Comparison: Compare the accuracy and performance of KNN, logistic regression, and decision tree models to determine the best model for survival prediction.
Data Visualization: Create insightful visualizations to explore the dataset and present key findings.
This project will help demonstrate the application of various machine learning techniques, data preprocessing, and model evaluation, while also providing valuable insights into the factors influencing train crash survival.
